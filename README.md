TaigaRest models is a package created to consume the data from Taiga (tree.taiga.io) webhooks, and put it
inside of Dart models, to use it on a project. We are using mappable models (https://pub.dev/packages/dart_mappable)

<ins> How to use (?) </ins>

First of all, you have to connect the taiga webhooks to your project on Dart (There is a guide: https://docs.taiga.io/webhooks-configuration.html#_developing_your_own_integration), once it is connected you have to decode the data using
the 'dart:convert' library (https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.2.1/dart-convert/dart-convert-library.html). 

This is the route where the webhook is hitting:
```
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';

class RouteRoot extends WidgetRoute {
  @override
  Future<Widget> build(Session session, HttpRequest request) async {
    final decodedBody = await utf8.decodeStream(request);
    final body = json.decode(decodedBody);
    
    // Convert the webhook payload into a dart model using 'fromJson' method
    final payload = TaigaPayload.fromJson(decodedBody);
    
    // Add your custom code to manage what to do after generate the model
    print(payload);

    return WebHooksView(webhookData: body);
  }
}
```

this will create the model with all the data you receive from Taiga. Is recommended to validate this data before using it, but is pending this. If you want to do it by yourself: https://docs.taiga.io/webhooks.html#_verify_signature

<ins> How to use custom fields (?) </ins>
For using custom fields of taiga (https://community.taiga.io/t/can-i-add-new-custom-fields-to-my-project/150) you have to modify the TaigaCustomFields model, in 'lib\src\models\taiga_payload\taiga_data\custom_fields\taiga_custom_fields.dart' by the moment. 

```
TaigaCustomFields({
    this.yourField,
  });

  /// Documentation of your field
  @MappableField(key: 'Name of your field')
  String? yourField;
```

remind the key is how it came from the Taiga webhook, and it will be the exact same name you put in your custom fields configuration on your Taiga project. Once you have done, then you have to generate the mappable models using:
```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```



## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Taiga Rest Models you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Install via `dart pub add`:

```sh
dart pub add taiga_rest_models
```

---

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Taiga Rest Models comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit tests:

```sh
dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```
